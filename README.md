My Final Project for COGS 18 Spring 2024 at the University of California San Diego.

This project uses very basic chatbot python coding to create a virtual fortune teller named Madam Antoinelle.  Through simple user input, Madam Antoinelle provides tarot card readings based on a predetermined list of categories such as love, family, and money.  Users interact with the bot by providng their name and choosing the category which they want a reading on and receive their responses - their card with its interpretation.  The chatbot continues the conversation based on the number of times the user asks for a reading until the user chooses to exit the program by inputing "exit".
The project uses a couple classes with their respective methods to provide the user-bot interaction such as sending the message and getting a response in addition to the functions that sort through the dictionary of all the tarot suits and cards with their interpretations and choose one at random in response to user input.
Madam Antoinelle's existence is thanks to Pandora, my tarot card deck that was sitting on my bookshelf who gave me the idea for the project as I was packing.  And also just because tarot readings are pretty cool.
